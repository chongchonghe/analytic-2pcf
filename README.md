## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

numpy, scipy, numba (optional)

### Executing program

The functions in `tpcf.py` can be used to compute the random-random
pair counts RR and the data-random pair counts DR analytically, using
`analytic_rr` and `analytic_dr`. A function `calculate_dd` is also
provided to compute the data-data pair counts DD using scipy.cKDTree.

For an example usage of the functions, check the `main` function in `main.py`.
